# Caterpillar

Remake of an old BBC Micro game I did when I was younger. This was done as a learning exercise so I avoided using any game engines or libraries and stuck to basic JavaScript and HTML Canvas.

The visual style is unashamedly retro and I tried to make the game play reminiscent of 8 bit arcade games.

The original was also super difficult so I made this version just as hard!

The game can be played in the browser here:
